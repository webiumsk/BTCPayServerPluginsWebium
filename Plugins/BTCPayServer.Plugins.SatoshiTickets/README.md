## Event Ticketing and Management System using Bitcoin via BTCPay Server


### Introduction

The Satoshi Tickets plugin enables users to sell tickets using Bitcoin payments via BTCPay Server.

**Decentralized and Self-Hosted:** Uses BTCPay Server, eliminating the need for third-party payment processors.

**Email Notifications:** Buyers receive confirmation emails with their QR-coded tickets.

**Ticket Scanner:** For physical events, events managers can now scan events to grant entry to attendee
